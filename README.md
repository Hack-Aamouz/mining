# Overview

**Reaver** has been designed to be a robust and practical attack against **Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)** registrar PINs in order to **recover WPA/WPA2 passphrases**. It has been tested against a wide variety of access points and WPS implementations.

The **original** Reaver implements a **online brute force attack** against, as described in [http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf](http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf). **Reaver-wps-fork-t6x** version **1.6.1** (and superior) is a **community forked version**, which has included **various bug fixes** and additional attack method (the **offline Pixie Dust** attack).

**Depending on the target's Access Point (AP)**, to recover the plain text WPA/WPA2 passphrase the **average** amount of time for the transitional **online brute force** method is **between 4-10 hours**. In practice, it will generally take half this time to guess the correct WPS pin and recover the passphrase.
When using the **offline attack**, **if** the AP is vulnerable, it may take only a matter of **seconds to minutes**.

# Requirements

```
apt-get -y install build-essential libpcap-dev aircrack-ng pixiewps
```
_The example uses [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) as the Operating System (OS) as `pixiewps` is included._

You must already have Wiire's pixiewps installed to be able to perform a pixie dust attack.
The latest version can be found here: [https://github.com/wiire/pixiewps](https://github.com/wiire/pixiewps).

## -K and-or -Z  // --pixie-dust (in reaver)

The `-K` and `-Z` option perform the offline attack, Pixie Dust _(`pixiewps`)_, by automatically passing the **PKE**, **PKR**, **E-Hash1**, **E-Hash2**, **E-Nonce** and **Authkey** variables. `pixiewps` will then try to attack **Ralink**, **Broadcom** and **Realtek** detected chipset.
**Special note**: If you are attacking a **Realtek AP**, **do NOT** use small DH Keys (`-S`) option.
User will have to execute reaver with the cracked PIN (option -p) to get the WPA pass-phrase. 
This is a temporary solution and an option to do a full attack will be implemented soon


## -a // --all  (in wash) 

The option `-a` of Wash will list all access points, including those without WPS enabled.
